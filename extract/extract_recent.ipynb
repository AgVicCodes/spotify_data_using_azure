    "\"\"\"The code is written in a procedural style, but there are several OOP concepts that you could apply to refactor and improve its structure and maintainability. Here are some ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "What It Is: Bundling data (like API keys, current time, etc.) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (i.e., a class).\n",
    "How to Apply It: Create a class (for example, SpotifyClient) that contains all the logic related to authentication, API calls, and saving the retrieved data. This way, the internal workings (like setting up the SpotifyOAuth or file management) are hidden from the rest of the application.\n",
    "Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "What It Is: Hiding complex implementation details behind a simpler interface.\n",
    "How to Apply It: Provide methods such as get_recently_played() in your class that perform the complex API calls and file writing behind the scenes, so users of the class only need to call a simple method without worrying about how it works internally.\n",
    "Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):\n",
    "\n",
    "What It Is: Every class should have one, and only one, reason to change.\n",
    "How to Apply It: Consider splitting the functionality into separate classes or modules. For example, one class can manage the Spotify API communication (handling authentication, making requests, etc.) while another can manage file operations (like saving JSON data to disk). This separation makes your code easier to maintain and test.\n",
    "Composition:\n",
    "\n",
    "What It Is: Building classes by combining simpler, reusable objects.\n",
    "How to Apply It: Your main SpotifyClient class could include an instance of a file manager class (or use dependency injection) to handle saving and loading data. This allows you to swap out or extend file handling functionality without changing the API-related logic.\n",
    "Polymorphism (and potentially Inheritance):\n",
    "\n",
    "What It Is: Designing classes so that they can be used interchangeably, especially when they share a common interface or base class.\n",
    "How to Apply It: If you plan on expanding your application to work with multiple music streaming services (e.g., Spotify, Apple Music), you could define an abstract base class or an interface (e.g., MusicServiceClient) that specifies common methods. Then, you can implement specific subclasses (e.g., SpotifyClient, AppleMusicClient) that override those methods with service-specific logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "How the OOP Concepts Are Applied:\n",
    "Encapsulation & Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "SpotifyClient handles all the Spotify-related logic.\n",
    "FileManager handles file operations.\n",
    "The user of these classes only needs to call get_recently_played() without worrying about the details.\n",
    "Single Responsibility Principle:\n",
    "\n",
    "SpotifyClient is responsible for interacting with the Spotify API.\n",
    "FileManager is responsible for saving files.\n",
    "Composition:\n",
    "\n",
    "SpotifyClient composes a FileManager instance to delegate file operations.\n",
    "Polymorphism & Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Although not fully demonstrated here, you could create a base class for music service clients and then extend it for different services, using polymorphism to call the same method on different client types.\n",
    "By applying these OOP concepts, your code becomes more modular, easier to test, and more flexible for future enhancements.\"\"\""
