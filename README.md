Recommendations for Improvement:

Comprehensive Documentation: Include a README file detailing the project's purpose, architecture, setup instructions, and how each component interacts within the ETL process.

Implementation Completion: Develop and integrate the transformation and load processes, ensuring data is processed and stored appropriately in Azure services.

Workflow Orchestration: Utilize Apache Airflow (as suggested by the repository structure) to manage and schedule ETL tasks effectively.

Error Handling and Logging: Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms to monitor the ETL pipeline's performance and troubleshoot issues.

Testing and Validation: Incorporate unit tests and data validation steps to ensure data integrity throughout the ETL process.
